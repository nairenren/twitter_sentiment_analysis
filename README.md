# twitter_sentiment_analysis
Crawling tweets to analyse the sentiment based on query and classify them using Naive Bayes algorithm. 

Training is done in every query fetching, you may improve this by separating the training and the query method itself.
Set the positive, neutral and negative words in train_set.csv.
The query is hard-coded in the code itself, you can manually set the param to your needs.

Hope this helps.
